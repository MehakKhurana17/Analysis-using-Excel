# Big Fashion Group Sales Analysis
Sales data for two Australia wide fashion stores that are Fashions Direct and Next Look is analyzed and represented on the dashboard using EXCEL.

## Introduction

Sales data is in a tabular format and is classified by date, financial year, chain, location (suburb/ state/ postcode/ country), manager, product category and product buyer. Data on sheet 1 is from Jan 2016 to June 2017 having approximately 68k rows. The next sheet 'Aug Data' contains further 4.5k rows of data for Aug 2017.
It is formatted in an Excel Table and this ensures any formulas, charts or PivotTables that reference the table automatically, or upon Refresh, pick up any changes or new data.
